# Discussion 01.1: Using GitHub Classrooms

## Student Information

* Eduardo Alba
* Fall/2024
* 77617

## Instructions

Write a program that:

1. Takes a single user input
1. Then outputs the text "Hello (Value of the Input)"
1. Test to ensure the program passes the provided test cases found in the [TESTS.md](TESTS.md) file

### Code to Add for Discussion

This partial code is being given to you so you can focus on learning how to commit your work into GitHub and reading the AutoGrading results in GitHub. You will still need to figure out how the code fits in with the existing starter code as it is not a 1-to-1 copy and paste fit.

```python
name = input("> ")

print("Hello", name)
```

## Rubric / Grading Criteria

See [Canvas](https://riohondo.instructure.com) for specific points breakdown on this assignment.

Grading is done via a combination of automatic grading in GitHub and manual testing by the instructor. Points may be deducted based on the following criteria:

* Must contain working Python code
  * Code follows all instructions listed above
  * Code is well structured, formatted, and commented
  * Code is able to be manually run without errors
  * Code uses concepts as covered in the current topic for the lab
  * Provided unit tests pass test with partial credit available for 1 or more passed tests
* More than 1 commit made by the student per GitHub Repo
* Tools such as the Measure of Software Similarity (MOSS) may be used to detect plagiarism

## Testing & Auto Grading

 Always try running your code in your local environment before submitting for grading and use the provided criteria for testing. Find more information on testing on the code read the [TESTS.md](TESTS.md) file.

All labs will be using GitHub Classroom Auto Grading as part of the testing process. However, you MUST test your code in your local environment before submitting. Troubleshooting and debugging code is a process that you must learn to be an effective programmer as you will not be given test cases in real world programming, you will have to write them yourself.

Commits made to save work in progress is acceptable even if it fails the auto grading. However you should remember that the class only gets **3000 minutes per month** for auto grading and will not run if we run out of minutes. So please do not make excessive commits to GitHub just to simply run the auto grading tests. Try to pass the provided tests in the [TESTS.md](TESTS.md) file first.

Auto Grading may use a combination of automated Input/Output testing, Unit Tests using pytest, or both via GitHub Classroom depending on the assignment. Scores in GitHub are not communicated to your Canvas lab assignment. The instructor must still manually grade each one then enter a grade.
